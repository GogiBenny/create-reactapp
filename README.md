# ReactApp

This project, named ReactApp, is a streamlined version of a React application built with Vite. The aim was to slim down the typical Create React App setup to include only the essentials needed for development. This customized setup includes Redux for state management, along with tailwind css.

## Getting Started

To get started with ReactApp, clone this repository and run the following commands:

npm install # Install dependencies
npm run dev # Start development server

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
